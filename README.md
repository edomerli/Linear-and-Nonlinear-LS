# Linear-and-Nonlinear-Least-Squares
Implementations of 2 algorithms: 
* solving the Least Squares problem through Normal Equations in order to classify handwritten digits
* solving Nonlinear Least Squares through Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm in order to train a neural network for function approximation
